# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Calulating-Net-Returns-Profits-using-TK-Solver-6.0
This is GUI based on the predictive model of crop production and the calculative model of TK Solver

1)Firstly, the user needs to select the crop:
	a)Click on the “Crop” menu in the menu bar. 
	b)Then select the type of crop. 
	c)After selecting the crop choose the state to which it belongs.
	d)Finally, select the district amongst the list given.
	e)The model has been generated as per the request for the prediction of yield.
 
2)The interface is designed to perform 2 sperate tasks in a combined form:

	A)Yield prediction:
		a)Enter “Area” value
		b)Enter “Production” value
		c)Now click on the “PREDICT” button to predict the yield
		d)Yield will be displayed in its respective location

	B)Further calculation:
		a)After performing above tasks fill up rest of the fields.
		b)Click on “CALCULATE” button. 
		c)Outputs will be generated and displayed.

NOTE: The model will not work without following the steps in the given sequence. Yield need to be predicted and not been entered by the user. In case the user enters the value of yield manually no outputs will be generated rather there would be errors displayed in the background.
